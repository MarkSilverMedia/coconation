        <span style="color:red;"><b>ATTENTION COCOHEADS:</b></span> Are you tired of being an irrelevant meme? Are you disgruntled at all the people that rightfully call me pretentious? Have you been waiting so long (tee-hee; another self reference!) for change in your silly little country?<br><br>Well, fear not, my loco cocos. Your lord and savior is here.<br><br>I, Diyath Yavin, am right here and now announcing my candidacy for the 2020 United States presidential election (even tho im in the uk lol). As your president, I will build an erstwhile wall against the US-Mexican border. If we find any pesky illegal immigrants on United States soil, we will "blissfully rapture" (deport) them without warning (even tho i assume <i>some</i> are sexi). I'm S-O-R-R-ie if this policy offends you, but they had to go away. Even if my campaign never sees the light amidst the fog, we will go down in history as having worked out of the possible in our efforts to Make America Read My Cheesy Liner Notes.
